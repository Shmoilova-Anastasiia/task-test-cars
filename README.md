# Car Rental App

Welcome to the Car Rental App! 
This project is a web application built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), designed to provide users with the ability to browse and rent cars from our company. The app includes three main pages: the home page, catalog page, and favorite page.

## Home Page

The home page serves as the landing page for the Car Rental App.

## Catalog Page

The catalog page allows users to browse our extensive collection of rental vehicles. Users can filter and search for cars based on various criteria, view details about each car, and initiate the rental process.

## Favorite Page

The favorite page lets users save their preferred vehicles for future reference. It provides a convenient way to keep track of cars they are interested in and make the rental process smoother.
